PathFinder management pack for SCOM
====================================

Why?
----

Nothing fancy, just a quick MP sketch that lets you make a quick check for
existence of any path on all Windows machines in your Operations Manager.

We all have been in a situation when we need to know whether an app X installed
on any computer in our environment. Or if a setting Y exists. Or module/feature
Z is installed.

This is a quick way to check it, it can find whatever Test-Path commandlet can
find. I also used it as a billet to create some fancier PMs monitoring
configuration states.

How to use?
-----------

Repository is a set of files generated by Visual Studio authoring extensions. To
start using it go to binand open the .xml file. Find and change \$Path variable
to whatever you are interested in, save the file and import it to SCOM.

Recalculation interval is 10 minutes, should work on SCOM 2012 and above.
